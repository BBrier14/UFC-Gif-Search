## Overview
The UFC Fighter Search app allows you to enter a fighter's name and find ten related GIF's
## How does it work?
The user can either click an existing name to find ten related GIF's or enter a name of their choosing into the search bar. The app will display ten static images. When an image is clicked, it will animate. When the image is clicked again, it will pause. The rating for each  GIF can be found underneath its corresponding image.
